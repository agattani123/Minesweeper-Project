/**
 * This class sets up the top-level frame and widgets for the GUI.
 * 
 * This game adheres to a Model-View-Controller design framework.  This
 * framework is very effective for turn-based games.  We STRONGLY 
 * recommend you review these lecture slides, starting at slide 8, 
 * for more details on Model-View-Controller:  
 * https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/files/slides/lec37.pdf
 * 
 * In a Model-View-Controller framework, Game initializes the view,
 * implements a bit of controller functionality through the reset
 * button, and then instantiates a GameBoard.  The GameBoard will
 * handle the rest of the game's view and controller functionality, and
 * it will instantiate a TicTacToe object to serve as the game's model.
